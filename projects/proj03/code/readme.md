Project 03 (Project 2 Solution by Russell J. Hewett) Adapted by Jack Jiang for Project 03
==========================================================================================


Here is a solution to Project 02.  It does not complete all of the experiments
(i.e., scripts are not provided) but it is a complete implementation of the
required coding steps.


Layout
------

* The makefile and main programs are in the root directory.
* The `include` directory contains all user-written header files.
* The `src` directory contains all user-written source files.


Building
--------

To compile all programs, run

    make

To build a specific program, run (for example)

   make wave_timing

Executing
---------

Each program takes 6 or 7 command line arguments to specify the parameters of
the wave simulation.  These are documented with the programs.

If you run the `wave_images` program for the required timesteps, you can run the
`plot_images.py` script to view the required plots.
